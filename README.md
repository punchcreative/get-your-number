<h1>get-your-number</h1>

This is  a Wordpress plug-in (still in development) to help with easy subscription to an event with a maximum of participants.

It's originaly initiated to enable subscription to a spinning event with a maximum of 35 participants. There are more participants who want to subscribe than that there are spinning bikes available and you don't want to use the principle 'who's first with describing gets a bike'. So here's what get-your-number is supposed to do for you when you open subscription.

<ul>
<li>set a range of numbers which overrides the amount of available bikes (e.g. 1 - 100)</li>
<li>let people subscribe using their emailadres and a name</li>
<li>after registration, give the subscriber a random and unique number within the range</li>
<li>send an email to the subscriber and an administrator</li>
</ul>

If an email adres already subscribed it's not able to get a second subscription

For now an administrator has to sort teh subscribers ascending on the number the got
This way you get a list where you can pick the first available (in my example 35) subscribers to join the activity
