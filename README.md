<h1>get-your-number</h1>

This is a Wordpress plug-in to help with subscription to an event with a maximum of participants but a lot more people who are willing to participate.
The plugin gives each subscriber a unique number, like a lottery. The numbers are generated within a range you can set in the admin settings for this plugin.
For instance:
You want to enable subscription to a spinning event with a maximum of 35 participants. There are more people who want to subscribe than that there are spinning bikes available and you don't want to use the principle 'who's first with describing gets a bike'. Well here's what get-your-number does for you.

<ul>
<li>set a range of numbers which largely overrides the amount of available places in the event (in my example i know the association has 100 members so i choose a range from 1 to 100, knowing not everyone is going to subscribe this is a safe range)</li>
<li>let people subscribe using their name and email</li>
<li>after registration, mail the subscriber, and the GYN administrator, the random and unique number that has been given</li>
</ul>

After you close the subscription, you can decide on how to make use of the numbers that are given.

Playing a Bingo could be one ;-)
