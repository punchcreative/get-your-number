get-your-number is  supposed to become a Wordpress plug-in to help with easy subscription to an event with a maximum of participants.

It's originaly initiated to enable subscription to a spinning event with a maximum of 35 participants.

There are more willing participants than that there are spinning bikes available, so here's what get-your-number is supposed to do for you when you open subscription

- set a range of numbers corresponding the available bikes
- let people subscribe using their emailadres and a name
- if there are still bikes available, give the subscriber a bike number
- if all bikes are already taken, give the subscriber the first following spare number

On the subscription page a list of the total of subscribers is shown

If an email adres already subscribed it's not able to get a second subscription

If for instance 2 bikes are given before the subscription opens, you can set the range of numbers to go from 2 -> 35
